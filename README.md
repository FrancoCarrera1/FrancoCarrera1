# Franco Carrera

I work in IT with a focus on cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and Linux. I like getting into the weeds of how systems actually work — setting things up, breaking them, figuring out why, and doing it better the next time. Lately I've been spending most of my time on container orchestration and cloud-native tooling.

## CKAD Killercoda Scenarios

**[ckad-killercoda-scenarios](https://github.com/FrancoCarrera1/ckad-killercoda-scenarios)**

I built 33 interactive Kubernetes scenarios for Killercoda covering all five CKAD exam domains. The goal was to create practice problems that actually feel like the exam — not toy examples, but scenarios where you have to think through the problem and use the right tools to solve it. Covers everything from RBAC and NetworkPolicy to Helm, Ingress, PV/PVC, Jobs, and debugging live clusters.

| Domain | Scenarios |
|--------|-----------|
| Application Environment, Configuration & Security | 8 |
| Application Design & Build | 7 |
| Application Deployment | 7 |
| Services & Networking | 7 |
| Application Observability & Maintenance | 4 |
